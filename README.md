# Brix Cider - Rshiny Logistic Regression App

A local cider company wanted to expand their business into a new city. Using their data, I used a logistic regression model to examine businesses within the new city to determine which businesses would most likely want to sell their products. 

This R Shiny app shows the logistic regression model and allows the user to choose different input variables to determine which are the most predictively accurate. It also shows a list of potenatial vendors in the new city and how they are ranked based on predictive percentages.
